As expected Manhattan is also the most common place for bike trips to end. 


## Summary: 
 From the data we can gather that the most common usage of the city bikes are going to be from individuals who are subscribed to the service and travel after the workday is over. The most common area being Manhattan can me and the majority of the bikers are tourists or individuals who live in that part of the city and need to travel a five minute distance. Two additional visualizations that may be helpful will be the most common bike IDs that are used to determine which  bicycles will need servicing and a visualization to determine the age ranges of our users to better market our product.
